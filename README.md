# JavaScript Video Series
In this video series, [Stephen Mayeux](http://stephenmayeux.com) walks through the algorithmic challenges at [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com).

## Viewing Tips

1. YouTube automatically plays videos at 480p, but it is recommended to play these videos at 720p High Definition and full screen.

2. These videos will be very practical because they will walk through the algorithmic challenges at Free Code Camp. As such, they will contain solutions to the challenges. If you want to solve the solution yourself, don't watch this video! When you have finally solved the challenge OR if you get stuck, come back and watch the video.

3. Do not be a passive learner. After watching each video, open up your favorite text editor and start applying what you have learned. Experiment with the syntax and be very, very curious. Read more about the syntax with the [official JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Just don't watch the videos without coding.
